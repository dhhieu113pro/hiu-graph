## Document Interconnections

These 10 documents are intentionally interconnected to demonstrate GraphRAG's ability to detect entities and relationships across multiple sources:

### Key Entity Types

- **People:** 25+ team members with roles, skills, and relationships
- **Projects:** Project Alpha (AI), Project Beta (Healthcare)
- **Organizations:** TechVenture, GlobalBank, Meridian Healthcare, Apex Manufacturing
- **Technologies:** Azure, GraphRAG, FastMCP, Python, TypeScript
- **Events:** Incidents, conferences, milestones, funding rounds

### Cross-Document Relationships

    ORG["company_org.md"] --> TM["team_members.md"]
    ORG --> PA["project_alpha.md"]
    ORG --> PB["project_beta.md"]

    TS --> EVT["company_events_timeline.md"]
```

### Example Queries Enabled

With 10 documents, you can ask complex cross-document questions:

1. **Cross-project:** "Which team members work on both Project Alpha and Project Beta?"
2. **Incident analysis:** "What incidents were caused by GraphRAG and who resolved them?"
3. **Customer relationships:** "Which Azure services are used for GlobalBank deployment?"
4. **Timeline correlation:** "What events happened around the time of INC-2024-001?"
5. **Technology coverage:** "Who are the experts in Python and what projects do they lead?"

## Statistics

After indexing, expect approximately:

- **100+ entities** across all entity types
- **300+ relationships** connecting entities
- **15+ communities** representing topic clusters
- Rich context for both local and global search queries
