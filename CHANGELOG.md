## [Unreleased]

## [4.2.0] - 2026-09-03

### Added

- **Router session-resume**: Router workflows resume multi-turn conversations from persisted session checkpoints, with expanded session-store and chatbot session-lifecycle documentation and test coverage. ([e6a9a46](https://github.com/cristofima/maf-graphrag-series/commit/e6a9a46))

## [3.0.0] - 2026-02-18

### Added

- **Part 3 agents module**: Microsoft Agent Framework integration. ([d71708c](https://github.com/cristofima/maf-graphrag-series/commit/d71708c))
  - `agents/config.py` - `AgentConfig` dataclass; loads Azure OpenAI config from env; supports `api_key` and `azure_cli` auth
  - `agents/prompts.py` - `KNOWLEDGE_CAPTAIN_PROMPT` system prompt driving tool selection
  - `agents/supervisor.py` - `KnowledgeCaptainRunner` context manager; `create_knowledge_captain()`; `AgentResponse` dataclass
  - `agents/__init__.py` - Public re-exports (`KnowledgeCaptainRunner`, `AgentConfig`)

- **Knowledge Captain agent pattern**:
  - Single `Agent` (GPT-4o) with `MCPStreamableHTTPTool` — no separate routing layer
  - System prompt routes questions to the right MCP tool (`local_search`, `global_search`, `list_entities`, `get_entity`)
  - `AgentSession` maintains conversation memory across multiple turns
  - `KnowledgeCaptainRunner` async context manager for safe setup/teardown
  - URL validation in `create_mcp_tool()` auto-corrects `/sse` → `/mcp`

- **`run_agent.py`**: CLI entrypoint with Rich formatting, interactive mode, and single-query mode.

- **Dependencies**:
  - `microsoft-agent-framework 1.0.0b260212` - `Agent`, `MCPStreamableHTTPTool`, `AzureOpenAIChatClient`, `AgentSession`
  - `azure-identity ^1.19.0` - Azure CLI credential support via `DefaultAzureCredential`
  - `httpx ^0.28.0` - Async HTTP client for MCP server communication

### Changed

- **BREAKING — MCP server transport split**: `streamable_http_app()` and `sse_app()` serving distinct endpoints. ([1ca5879](https://github.com/cristofima/maf-graphrag-series/commit/1ca5879))
  - `/mcp` (Streamable HTTP) — for `MCPStreamableHTTPTool` in Microsoft Agent Framework
  - `/sse` (SSE) — for MCP Inspector and browser-based clients
  - Clients connecting via `/sse` for MAF integration must update URL to `/mcp`
- **`mcp_server/server.py`**: `streamable_http_app()` route at `/mcp` alongside `sse_app()` at `/sse`, with both transports on port 8011. ([1ca5879](https://github.com/cristofima/maf-graphrag-series/commit/1ca5879))
- **Version bump**: 2.0.0 → 3.0.0.
- **README**: Part 3 section with architecture diagrams, Mermaid flow, quick start, and usage examples. ([340b7b0](https://github.com/cristofima/maf-graphrag-series/commit/340b7b0), [030b71b](https://github.com/cristofima/maf-graphrag-series/commit/030b71b))
- **`docs/lessons-learned.md`**: Transport protocol notes and MAF integration lessons. ([030b71b](https://github.com/cristofima/maf-graphrag-series/commit/030b71b))
- **`docs/part2-implementation-notes.md`**: Clarified Streamable HTTP vs SSE transport roles. ([adfcea0](https://github.com/cristofima/maf-graphrag-series/commit/adfcea0))
