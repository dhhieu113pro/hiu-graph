Global Search MCP Tool

Community-focused search for broad, thematic questions.
Best for: "What are the main projects?", "Summarize the organization"

Note: Global search uses map-reduce over community reports, not individual
text units. It never receives text_units, so source-level document traceability
is not available (by design in GraphRAG).

    """
    Search the knowledge graph for broad themes and organizational insights.

    This tool analyzes community reports (summaries of graph communities) to
    provide high-level overviews and thematic insights across the entire organization.

    Args:
        query: The question to answer (e.g., "What are the main projects?")
        community_level: Community hierarchy level (0-2, higher = smaller communities)
        response_type: Format of response ("Multi-Page Report", "Multiple Paragraphs", etc.)
        dynamic_community_selection: Enable dynamic community selection

    Returns:
        dict: Contains 'answer', 'context', and 'search_type'.
              Unlike local search, global search does not return document-level
              sources because it synthesizes from community reports (aggregated summaries).

    Examples:
        - "What are the main projects and teams?"
        - "Summarize the organizational structure"
        - "What engineering processes are used?"
        - "What Azure services are used across the organization?"
