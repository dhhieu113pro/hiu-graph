"""
Sequential Workflow - Research Pipeline

Implements a 3-step sequential workflow where each agent's output becomes
the context for the next agent. This pattern is ideal for complex questions
that benefit from structured decomposition before searching.

Pipeline:
    1. QueryAnalyzer   → Decomposes the query into a structured research plan
    2. KnowledgeSearcher → Executes searches via MCP based on the plan
    3. ReportWriter    → Synthesizes findings into a well-structured report

Usage:
    from maf_graphrag.workflows.sequential import ResearchPipelineWorkflow

    async with ResearchPipelineWorkflow() as workflow:
        result = await workflow.run("What are the leadership and technology strategy of Project Alpha?")
        print(result.answer)
        print(result.step_summary())

When to Use This Pattern:
    - Complex, multi-part questions that need upfront decomposition
    - When you want clear traceability through each reasoning step
    - When you need a structured report rather than a conversational reply
    - Research-style queries that blend entity facts with thematic context

Contrast with Single-Agent (Part 3):
    | Aspect          | Part 3 (Single Agent)    | Part 4 Sequential          |
    |-----------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
    | Steps           | 1 (direct Q&A)           | 3 (analyze → search → write)|
    | Traceability    | Black box                | Full step log              |
    | Output format   | Conversational           | Structured report          |
    | Best for        | Quick questions          | Complex research queries   |

_QUERY_ANALYZER_PROMPT = """You are a Research Planner. Your job is to analyze a user's question and
produce a structured search plan for querying a knowledge graph about TechVenture Inc.

## Your Output Format

Return a concise JSON-like plan with these fields:
- **primary_question**: The core question to answer
- **search_type**: "local" (specific entities) or "global" (themes/patterns) or "both"
- **entities_of_interest**: List of specific entity names to focus on (people, projects, etc.)
- **sub_questions**: 1-3 specific sub-questions that together answer the main query

## Rules
- Be specific about entity names when the question mentions them
- Prefer "local" whenever the question mentions specific entities, projects, people, or technologies
- Only recommend "global" for very broad organizational/strategic overview questions
- Recommend "both" sparingly — only when the question clearly needs both entity details AND broad themes
- Keep sub-questions short and search-friendly

## Example Output
Primary question: What are the leadership and technology strategy of Project Alpha?
Search type: local
Entities of interest: Project Alpha, Dr. Emily Harrison
Sub-questions:
  1. Who leads Project Alpha and what is their role?
  2. What technologies are used in Project Alpha?

- **global_search**: Slow (map-reduce across all communities). Use ONLY for broad organizational
  overview questions that cannot be answered by local_search.

## Instructions
1. Read the research plan carefully
2. **Strongly prefer local_search** — it handles most questions well, including listing projects
   and tech stacks, finding relationships, and entity details
3. Only use global_search if the question explicitly asks for organizational-wide themes,
   strategic patterns, or cross-cutting insights that local_search cannot answer
4. **Never call global_search more than once** — it is expensive and slow
5. Combine sub-questions into a single well-crafted search query when possible,
   rather than making separate calls for each sub-question
6. Include specific entity names, relationships, and quotes from the knowledge graph

## Output Format
Return all search findings as structured text with clear sections per sub-question.
Label each section with the sub-question it answers."""

3. Organize information logically (not just copying search output)
4. Use markdown headings and bullet points for clarity
